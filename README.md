# School_Timer_2024
My relatives has a school, of little children, and sometimes the personal in charge of ringing the bell are very busy with some issues which comes with School Managing job; so, the schedules some times are not accomplished. So, I decided to build many years ago, a Timer capable to ring a bell, alarm, whatever attached to its relay at determinate times of day. All this first prototype, only using test pcb stripped boards, not in a finished PCB BOARD with professional quality. THIS YEAR, is the year.

Design based on PIC 16F877A, with ring the Bell in schedules programmed automatically, no need to human intervention.

Mode 1: Set Events Time (events from 1 to 20)

Bellow, a video showing how its activated the Relay to ring the Bell, at events time programmed:
